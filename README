==== Trappiste ====

Trappiste is a small program to help (net|sys)admins to
backup cisco switches & routers configs in git without having
any action to do.

When you write the config a trap is sent to a snmptrapd that 
handles it by forwarding to the script

===== Installation =====

You will need the following perl modules

- SNMP::Trapinfo
- Git::Repository
- AppConfig

===== Companions ===== 

You wil also need a tftp server, snmptrapd, git and the cisco MIBS

Configuration for snmpdtrapd (from net-snmp) :

  authCommunity log,execute,net <yourcommunity>
  traphandle default /path/to/trappiste.pl

Configuration for your network device :
  snmp-server community <omgsecret> RW
  snmp-server enable traps config
  snmp-server host <mighty host> <yourcommunity> config
  
===== Use =====

trappiste is a beerware, if you use it and that we meet you may offer me a beer (belgian beer > *)
